# InvestAndFundAngularApp

This is a simple web app with 3 components Home, Blog, and About and 2 services BlogService, and CompanyService. 
Users can navigate between components some mock data from the service is displayed to show data flow.
Services include methods for getting mock data and fetching real data from the backend (those are not used just to demonstrate where they could be placed). 
  
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
